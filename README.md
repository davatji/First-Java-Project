# First-Java-Project
My first meaningful programming project in Java. Creating a simple game controller preceded with a basic interface to allow users setting the parameters that influence how the game is run.

Note that this is my first experience in Java, altough that I have been familiar with C#. I am attempting to make my program as modular and clean as possible. 
Any suggestion on improvements are warmly accepted.
